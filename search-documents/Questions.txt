Problem Statement: Relevance Scoring

When a user submits a query to a search engine, the first thing the engine must do is to determine which pages(documents) in the index are related to the query. The goal of this task is to compute a relevance score. This score should gauge the similarity between the query and documents

Data:
1. data/: contains list of documents.
2. query: contain list of queries

Your solution to the problem should be written to a directory called "output/". The structure of the output directory should be such that 
1.There should be a file generated for each query.
2.The generated files should have same name as that of query.
3.The generated file should consist of list of documents sorted by their relevence score in descending order.

(PS: Not allowed to use information retrieval software library for example Apache Lucene, Elasticsearch etc.)
